pls don't do anything stupid to the code if u don't know what u're doing. 
k here's the steps: 
extract the zip files. 
to run the game u'll need Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
and the .NET core: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/ (download the SDK one) 
after done installing visual studio code, open the "Learning C Sharp" folder inside the "Learning C Sharp (the one u have extracted)" folder. go to Program.cs 
then press F5 (or go to Run > Start Debugging) 
now wait for it to launch the Command Prompt, 
that'll be where u'll play.
